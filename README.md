## 🔧 Features
- Buzzer plays short song melodies (using tone & `pitches.h`)
- Players press buttons to buzz in and guess
- LEDs show which player buzzed first
- LCD displays messages or scores 

## 🧠 What You Learn
- Arduino programming with `tone()` and `digitalRead()`
- Working with buttons, buzzers, LEDs, and LCDs
- Game logic and timing in embedded systems

## 📄 Code Structure
- `music_guess.ino`: main game logic
- `pitches.h`: tone frequency definitions for notes

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the `.ino` file to your Arduino board.
2. Set up the circuit according to the schematic or code.
3. Power on and let the game begin!
